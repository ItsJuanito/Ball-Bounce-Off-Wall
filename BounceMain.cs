//Program name: "Ricochet Ball".  This program shows a ball moving in a straight line.  When it reaches a wall it ricochets *
//off of that wall and continues its linear motion.                                                                          *

//Program name: Assignment 4
//Programming language: C#
//Date project began: November 26, 2022
//Date project last updated: November 27, 2022

//Purpose: This program is one in a series of programs used as teaching examples in the C# programming course.  This
//program demonstrates how an elastic ball collides physically with another hard object -- in this case a wall.

//Improvements needed:
//1.  An exit button
//2.  Real-time instantaneous display of coordinates
//3.  Ricochet capability on the north, west, and south sides.
//4.  Hyper jumping: in place of ricochet cause the ball to re-appear on the left as it exits from the right.
